//no system is introduced by indian
/*
egypt= base60
india= decimal no system = base 10 {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, Arithmetic operations are easy
computer = to calculate //mechanical comp = need a human for machine chalane ke liye
//then transistors comes in excisting
//then binary no : ye bhi india ne banaya   //but Gottfried wilhelm Leibniz self claimed author that he inveted BN
//octa : we can find then in IP address
hexa: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F


Moore Law:Every 2 year the capacity of transistors doubles
comp lang: binary lang/machine lan: 0 1
Machine Lang >> Assembly lang >> High level lang    (slow to fast)
